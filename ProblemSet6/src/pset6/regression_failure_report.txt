27 tests failed if the test suite is used to test against the webpage minandmax.html.
These failures are not bugs in minandmax.html page, but are faulty tests beacause the
output messages are supposed to be "max..." instead of "min...".
Example error message: "expected: <min(-3, 0, 7) = -3> but was: <max(-3, 0, 7) = 7>".
128*(1/2)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(3/4) = 27.
